Recipe Website

Recipe webpage gonna consist of 3 main recipes:
1. Quick Chicken Piccata
2. Potato Kielbasa Skillet
3. Prawn and Harissa Spaghetti

I included an unordered list to the links in the index.html file to make sure they are not one line.
Each link has a relative path within a page to the dish recipe.

For each recipe page i added:
-Image of the recipe
-Description
-Ingredients
-Steps for the ingredients
